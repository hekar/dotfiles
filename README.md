dotfiles
==========

These are my dotfiles. I have not changed the repository name, because many machines are pointed to this repository.

I primarily use Fedora. Beyond Fedora is not well tested, unless I have recently configured a machine with that operating system.

Loosely supports the following Linux distributions:

1. [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/)
1. [OpenSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/)
1. [CentOS](https://www.centos.org/).
1. [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) (Partial support)

Contains configuration:

1. [i3](https://i3wm.org/)
1. [vim](http://www.vim.org/)
1. [zsh](http://www.zsh.org/)
1. [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)

## Quick Setup

See [setup.sh](https://raw.github.com/hekar/vim-n-home/master/setup.sh) for the exact details of the script.

```
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/hekar/vim-n-home/master/setup.sh)"
```

## Manual Setup

Clone this repository. Copy the contents (including hidden files) to ~/.

## Shortcuts

Few keyboard shortcuts are listed, because the likelihood of this being used by more than myself is rather slim.
