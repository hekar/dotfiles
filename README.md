## Quick Setup

See [setup.sh](https://raw.github.com/hekar/dotfiles/master/setup.sh) for the exact details of the script.

```
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/hekar/dotfiles/master/setup.sh)"
```

## Manual Setup

Clone this repository. Copy the contents (including hidden files) to ~/.

## Shortcuts

Few keyboard shortcuts are listed, because the likelihood of this being used by more than myself is slim.
