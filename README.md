dotfiles
==========

I primarily use Fedora. Distributions other than Fedora are not well tested.

Supports the following distributions:

1. [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/)
1. [OpenSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/)
1. [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) (Partially)

Installs and configures:

1. [i3](https://i3wm.org/)
1. [vim](http://www.vim.org/)
1. [zsh](http://www.zsh.org/)
1. [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh

## Quick Setup

See [setup.sh](https://raw.github.com/hekar/dotfiles/master/setup.sh) for the exact details of the script.

```
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/hekar/dotfiles/master/setup.sh)"
```

## Manual Setup

Clone this repository. Copy the contents (including hidden files) to ~/.

## Shortcuts

Few keyboard shortcuts are listed, because the likelihood of this being used by more than myself is slim.
